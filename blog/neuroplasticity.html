        <h3 class="question">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Knowing that we have the ability to positively or negatively affect how our brain develops. Our brains continue to work at a 
            high level for extended periods of time the more we challenge and engage our mind and body. The development of neuroplastic 
            change has a wide range of potential benefits including the ability to pick up new skills, improve current cognitive abilities 
            and capacities, it also aids in the rehabilitation of people that have had strokes and many more .
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="question">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Finding something new I'm genuinely interested in and being able to engage in that activity with the right intention to learn, 
            also applying repetition and intensity as that's how I tend to learn best... and sleep.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="question">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          good quality sleep and meditation can aid in helping your body adapt to stress improving productivity and efficency, improving 
           your rate of neuroplasticity in the process in addition to that, Exercising frequently is also said to help reduce not just muscular
           atrophy but also brain atrophy helping preserve motor function as we age and supports the relearning of motor abilities also
           improving neuroplacticty

        <h2 class="content-heading">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3 class="question">DISCUSS WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT IS RELEVANT</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          It's the idea of letting go of old habits and beliefs and opening ones self to change , growth and open-mindedness
            As opposed to having a limited mindset. I believe mindset in general has a big impact on your perspective of life
            which in turn changes your whole experience. I believe this quote has some relevance to the subject. 
            <br>
            “Eventually you will see that the real cause of problem is not life itself. It's 
            the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes the problem” - Michael A. Singer
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="question">IN THIS EXPLORATION, DID ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU? CHANGE FOR YOU?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          It definitely reaffirmed the value of having an open mind, but I wasn't surprised or noticed 
          any changes in myself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="question">HOW WILL YOU INTERGRATE GROWTH MINDSET INTO YOUR LEARNING JOURNEY?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          referring to my learning plan where I discussed some of my weaknesses, like having unrealistic expectations of myself
          and the occasional episode of self-doubt, I want to build on these keeping an open mind and allowing for improvement in 
          those areas and more.

        <h3 class="question">BLEND WITH YOUR LEARNING PLAN AND STRATERGIES</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          by keeping in mind the principles and benefits of both Neuroplasticity and growth mindset i think it'll have a positive
           impact on my learning plan  and learning journey in general
